# Personal Website

Well hello there! How did you end up here?

This is the source code for my personal website, hosted with Github Pages.
Feel free to take a look around, or use it as a template for your own!

## Build

The site is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [Hugo Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme. To spin up a server, do the following:

* Clone this repo recursively (to include submodule theme).
* Install Hugo Extended and add to path.
* Serve with `hugo server` from the project directory.
